## 📋 **Content Structure**

### **Module 1: Python Basics**
```
Topics:
1. Python Syntax & Structure - Learn Python's clean syntax, indentation rules, comments, and program structure. Covers basic syntax, proper indentation, comments (# and '''), and program organization.

2. Variables & Data Types - Master variables, integers, floats, strings, booleans, and type conversion. Learn variable naming rules, data type functions (int(), float(), str()), and type checking with type().

3. Operators & Expressions - Understand arithmetic, comparison, logical operators, and expression evaluation. Covers +, -, *, /, //, %, **, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, and, or, not operators.

4. Input & Output Operations - Learn print() function, input() function, and string formatting. Master f-strings, .format(), % formatting, and handling user input with proper type conversion.
```

### **Module 2: Control Flow**
```
Topics:
1. If-Else Statements - Learn conditional execution with if, elif, and else statements. Master nested if statements, multiple conditions, and proper indentation for control flow.

2. For Loops - Iterate over sequences with for loops and range() function. Learn iterating over lists, strings, dictionaries, and using enumerate() for index access.

3. While Loops - Create loops that continue while a condition is true. Master loop control, infinite loop prevention, and proper loop termination conditions.

4. Loop Control Statements - Use break, continue, and pass statements to control loop execution. Learn when and how to use each control statement effectively.
```

### **Module 3: Data Structures**
```
Topics:
1. Lists and List Methods - Create and manipulate ordered, mutable sequences. Master append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), sort(), reverse(), and list comprehensions.

2. Tuples - Work with immutable, ordered sequences of elements. Learn tuple packing, unpacking, single-element tuples, and when to use tuples vs lists.

3. Dictionaries - Store key-value pairs in unordered, mutable collections. Master dict methods, nested dictionaries, dictionary comprehensions, and key-value operations.

4. Sets - Manage unordered collections of unique elements. Learn set operations (union, intersection, difference), set comprehensions, and when to use sets.
```

### **Module 4: Functions and Modules**
```
Topics:
1. Function Definition - Define and call functions with parameters and return values. Learn function syntax, docstrings, return statements, and function scope.

2. Parameters and Arguments - Use default parameters, keyword arguments, and variable arguments (*args, **kwargs). Master parameter passing and argument unpacking.

3. Return Values - Understand return statements, multiple return values, and None. Learn when and how to return values from functions effectively.

4. Importing Modules - Organize code with modules and import functionality. Master import statements, from...import, import as, and module organization.
```

### **Module 5: Object-Oriented Programming**
```
Topics:
1. Classes and Objects - Create classes and instantiate objects with attributes and methods. Learn class definition, object creation, instance variables, and method definition.

2. Methods and Constructors - Use __init__ method and define instance and class methods. Master constructors, instance methods, class methods, and static methods.

3. Inheritance - Create class hierarchies and inherit attributes and methods. Learn single inheritance, multiple inheritance, method overriding, and super() function.

4. Polymorphism - Implement method overriding and understand polymorphic behavior. Master method overloading, operator overloading, and polymorphic function calls.
```

### **Module 6: File Handling and Exceptions**
```
Topics:
1. Reading Files - Read from files using different modes (r, rb, r+). Learn file reading methods, line-by-line reading, and file cursor positioning.

2. Writing Files - Write to files using different modes (w, a, wb). Master file writing methods, appending data, and file truncation.

3. Try-Except Blocks - Use try-except blocks to handle errors and exceptions. Learn exception types, multiple except clauses, and finally blocks.

4. File Operations - Work with file paths, directories, and file system operations. Master os.path, pathlib, and file manipulation utilities.
